Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

So far, I have started to code my custom synthesizer. I have tested various attributes to find the sound that I am looking for. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I have not yet finalized my synthesizer. I also plan on coding multiple instruments to pair with my audio tracks to create a song.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Magenta Tensorflow has been useful in guiding me, so I have not not had any issues I could not resolve. I mostly spent time on testing the various sounds for my synth.
